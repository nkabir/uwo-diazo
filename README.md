# UWO Diazo

A minimal implementation of diazo for UW Oshkosh Plone sites. This theme uses the Bootstrap 3 grid to replace portal-column-content, portal-column-one and portal-column-two. Currently, if one column (portal-column-content only) that column will be full width inside its container. If two columns (portal-column-content and portal-column-one or portal-column-two) it will give 2/3 to content and 1/3 to the other column. If all three columns are present it will be 1/4 2/4 1/4.

This is a work in progress and currently includes elements that don't belong in the theme, such as angular.
